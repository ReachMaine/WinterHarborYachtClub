    <h2 class="textcenter">SONGS  OF THE WINTER HARBOR YACHT CLUB<br />
    </h2>
    <p class="textcenter"><em>By Wilmot Lewis and Scott Landreth</em>....</p>
    <p class="textcenter">For  it's home, boys, home, oh, it's home we want to be,<br />
      Back  in our home by the side of the sea,<br />
      Back  in our seats at the Winter Harbor Club,<br />
      Where  they mix the bonnie liquor in a twenty-gallon tub.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Oh!  Once again we're gathered 'round the wet and festive board,<br />
      Once  more we raise our voices in petition to the Lord<br />
      To  grant us decent breezes that will waft us on our road,<br />
    And  to spare us all the dreadful fate of being forever towed.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I  give you Mr. Henderson, the man who runs the place,<br />
      He  tries his very best to win in every single race.<br />
      He  always takes a lady out to help him with the boat,<br />
      And  if perchance he doesn't win, the girl becomes the goat.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Oh!  Mitchell Rosengarten likes the races in a gale;<br />
      He  tears across the starting line and never shortens sail.<br />
      He  shouts at little Warner, &quot;This is what I call a breeze,<br />
      Lie  flat upon your belly and I'll crown you if you sneeze.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">John  Davis is a sailorman, the heaviest we've reared,<br />
      The  only motion on his boat's the breezes in his beard.<br />
      Maneuvering  'round the starting line I heard him loudly shout,<br />
  &quot;Excuse  the interruption, boys, but what's it all about?&quot;</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Gene  Dixon has an awful job, it almost gets his goat,<br />
      His  crew run all around the deck and nearly sink the boat.<br />
      And  when they set an extra sail, they work so very fast<br />
      That  they never get it settled 'til the finish line is passed.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Now  Little Charlie Cheston owns a boat he doesn't sail,<br />
      He  has exciting races, but he does it through the mail.<br />
      So  when his boat has won a race he gets a telegram,<br />
      And  he simply takes another drink, he doesn't give a damn!</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Now  Mr. Hammond's very quiet and most efficient, too.<br />
      His  boat she travels 'round the course as though she had a screw.<br />
      He  eggs you on to win a race and then she shows his legs.<br />
      Oh,  there isn't any doubt of it, for surely Hammond eggs.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Old  Sam Henderson, a sailorman of note,<br />
      Ships  a load of ladies in his black and sinful boat.<br />
      So  when he's crossed the starting line heruns away and plays.<br />
      He  may not win the races, but he has some perfect days.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Old  Matt Maury, a sailor of renown,<br />
      Says  &quot;Every dog must have his day, we all go up and down.<br />
      But  someday soon I'll win a race, and when that comes to pass,<br />
      You  are hereby all invited just to kiss my royal ___!&quot;</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Old  Sam Davis has left us for a while.<br />
      We  miss his girlish laughter and his scintillating smile.<br />
      His  boat is now being handled by a very Willling crew.<br />
      They're  willing to do anything, but don't know what to do.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Dal  Dixon several years ago just loved to sail a race<br />
      And  frequently in bygone days he used to set the pace.<br />
      But  now I heard them ask him if he'd like to have a try,<br />
      He  simply shook his head and said, &quot;I think I'll stick to Rye.&quot;</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Oh,  now we'll sing of Mr. Noyes, the man who owns the &quot;Star,&quot;<br />
      An  honorary member of the Winter Harbor Bar.<br />
      His  son-in-law's been knighted, and it's certain as can be<br />
      That  Mr. Noyes will soon be holding &quot;Hands across the sea.&quot;</p>
    <p class="textcenter">John  Price Wetherill, Jr., My! But that's a name.<br />
      Trapping  English sparrows put him in the Hall of Fame.<br />
      He  bands them every single time they chance to come around.<br />
      Some  of the birds have a hell of a time in gertting off the ground.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Oh  Mr. Berkeley Taylor is the hardy pioneer<br />
      Who  landed first upon these shores with whiskey, wine, and beer.<br />
      He's  watched six different managements go quietly up the spout,<br />
      And  he doesn't give a damn because his liquor's holding out.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Oh,  Mr. Corlies Morgan runs the Pari Mutuel,<br />
      And  from the Banker's standpoint, boys, I'll say he runs it well.<br />
      You  put five dollars in the pot and get the winning smack,<br />
      Then  under Morgan's system you can have your money back.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Oh,  Bert's the Judge, but mark my words, he still has lots to learn;<br />
      He  doesn't know the bowsprit from the cockpit or the stern.<br />
      He  cruises 'round the ocean with a belly full of gin;<br />
      The  only thing that Bert decides is when to tow them in.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Old  George Dixon, on the porch he holds his class,<br />
      And  stretches out the glad hand to all the guests who pass.<br />
      He  brings us in to luncheon and he puts us in our place,<br />
      And  he calls so many speakers that we can't get off to race.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Alas!  George Dallas Dixon has resigned the luncheon throne,<br />
      But  for a thousand years to come we'll claim him for our own.<br />
      He  now refuses to preside, but let us thank the Lord<br />
      He'll  be elected by acclaim as Chairman of the Board.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Our  leader, Berkely Taylor, keeps a tavern of renown.<br />
      And  to it flock assorted guests from in and out of town.<br />
      What  happens when the doors are closed, no one can ever doubt,<br />
      For  though the guests go walking in they always stagger out.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Let's  sing of old John Davis, who has left the sporting game,<br />
      Abandoning  athletics for a life of sloth and shame;<br />
      He  likes to lounge beside the pool, where beauty does invite him,<br />
      But  he always keeps his blinkers on for fear it might excite him.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Our  next is Corlies Morgan, the Treasurer is he<br />
      Of  old Ben Franklin's Pennsylvania University.&quot;<br />
      If  its accounts are handled like our Pari Mutuel,<br />
      'Twill  not be long before his Alma Mater goes to hell!</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Old  Mitchell Rosengarten, a shooter is of note,<br />
      Of  crap and quail and canvasback, and what goes down his throat.<br />
      His  life has been erratic, but it's twenty times erraticker<br />
      Since  Mitchell Rosengarten was stricken with sciatica.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Now  Charlie's been a lowly gob for lo! these many years,<br />
      He  ate the bread of sorrow and he drank the cup of tears.<br />
      Now  Brother John has trusted Charles to show a little speed,<br />
      And  John will soon find out he leans upon a broken Reed.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">When  deficits are mounting, and trade is in a jam,<br />
      The  nation's last resort has been &quot;Appeal to Uncle Sam!&quot;<br />
      Our  Uncle Sam, however, is not worried by the crash...<br />
      He  just divides the deficit and asks us all for cash.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">A  nautical authority is Mr. Robert Fell,<br />
      He  judged the races fourteen years and dodged the issues well.<br />
      Now  Scott has been elected -- they come from different schools --<br />
      But  they have one point in common, for neither knows the rules!</p>
    <p class="textcenter">A  happy man was Frank N. Noyes when he put out to sea,<br />
      His  yacht packed to the gunwales with femininity;<br />
      He  was frolicsome with dark brunettes or Titian reds in dozens --<br />
      But  they were never were his sisters or his daughters or his cousins.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">When  every land's complaining of the horrors of deflation,<br />
      Price  Wetherill's a paradox, he grows by liquidation!<br />
      His  abdomen, enough for ten, does strain upon his shirt;<br />
      It's  the only thing, God save the King! As big as Mt. Desert.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Joe  Thayer's the blue-eyed baby who has never had enough;<br />
      Though  weaned on Benedictine, he despised the milky stuff;<br />
      He  cried for Russian vodka at the tender age of eight,<br />
      And  now he drinks wood alcohol, and always takes it straight.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Oh,  Harry Platt is here again, to jopin our jolly crew,<br />
      He  doesn't know a halyard from a forcing bid of two;<br />
      When  his skipper in a passion said, &quot;Get busy now, you clown!&quot;<br />
      Our  Harry said, &quot;Aye, aye, sir!&quot; -- and he let the mainsail down.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Doctor  Edward Krumbhaar pretends to love the sea.<br />
      But  what he's interested in is just pathology.<br />
      He  took a test of Price's blood and had conniption fits,<br />
      For  what the slide revealed was unadulterated Schlitz.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">In  the multitude of Dixons there is one named Fitz Eugene,<br />
      But  yachting and the tennis court sometimes confuse his bean.<br />
      It's  hard upon his crew when, in a period of squalls,<br />
      They  ask their skipper what he wants, and Genie answers &quot;Balls!&quot;</p>
    <p class="textcenter">The  Lord he made the Englishman, but nobody knows why,<br />
      Unless  he needed something to try our patience by.<br />
      So  here we have Sir Wilmot Lewis, and when he heaves in sight,<br />
      Though  day be perfect yet we know we'll have a dreadful Knight.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Scott  Landreth is a bon vivant of credit and renown,<br />
      When  someone else provides the cup he'll always drink it down;<br />
      On  exceptional occasions he invites us all to swill,<br />
      But  the records show, alas! heighho! He never foots the bill.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">CHORUS</p>
    <p class="textcenter">It's  home, girls, home, it's home you ought to be,<br />
      Back  in your homes and a-brewing your tea,<br />
      And  not in your seats in the Winter Harbor Club<br />
      Where  they brew forbidden liquor in a twenty-gallon tub.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">There  are some that are pot-valiant, but Dimple doesn't sup,<br />
      There  are some that go pot-hunting, put Dimple wants no cup;<br />
      She's  interested in the draw that brings her crew's selection,<br />
      She  wants to add Sam Henderson to the Widener collection.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Old  Marlowe said that Helen's face had launched a thousand ships,<br />
      But  we've two Helens who remain, in nautical eclipse;<br />
      One's  a putting wonder, the other plays the net,<br />
      But  when it comes to knockabouts, these Helens are &quot;all wet.&quot;</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Just  a word on Paget Platt, a simple Southern maid,<br />
      Who  sails a boat as though she meant to break the Yank blockade,<br />
      She's  independent of the breeze, she laughs at drifting spells,<br />
      For  she fills her sails and drives along by force of Rebel yells.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Now  raise your glass to Aimee Thayer, that striking, Viking blonde,<br />
      This  maid demure, with morals pure, who's known by &quot;tout le monde,&quot;<br />
      One  twinkle of her roguish eye, one wiggle of her hips,<br />
      Would  sound the call to action on a fleet of battleships.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Now  Isabel's a sailor lass who's raced for many years,<br />
      And  rounded many buoys with curses ringing in her ears;<br />
      As  to the boat she sails today she doesn't give a damn.<br />
      Her  motto crude, both firm and rude, is just &quot;To hell with Sam!&quot;</p>
    <p class="textcenter">If  our racing regulations were only free for all,<br />
      We'd  have a naval contest of the sort that cannot pall,<br />
      Between  two doughty Amazons, two grand old salts, by Jingo!<br />
      Mrs.  Gummey on the Elrod, Mrs. Davis on the Bingo.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Serene  above the battle, for shes counts no seaman's job hers,<br />
      Sits  Mrs. Groome, the matriarch of all the Pencoyd robbers,<br />
      Her  name it once was Roberts, and her lineage was old --<br />
      The  Newbolds do not please her, for she thinks them new and bold.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Then  there are Fanny Landreth and her cousin Janet Noyes.<br />
      Though  their lovely locks are powdered they can still corral the boys.<br />
      In  them the Newbold blood is blue; of them it is a truth<br />
      That  though others may advance in age, these two advance in youth.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">But  who are these who cover make of a verandah screen?<br />
      Maria,  Floss, and Charlotte, and also Mary Dean.<br />
      Battle-scarred  and bottle-scared, bloodthirsty, unafraid,<br />
      They  are the hardy veterans of the old Mah Jongg brigade.</p>

    <p class="textcenter">LADIES  RACE DAY</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I  am the blonde Aimee don't anyone blame me<br />
      If  I never win any race, I've had the best crew<br />
      Anyone  ever drew, but I lost<br />
    What  a frost, and they say --</p>
    <p class="textcenter">My  name's Louise Maury, I'll tell you a story<br />
      Of  sailing the waters of Maine. What a chance to come through<br />
      With  the regular crew, what a shame<br />
      Who's  to blame, and they say --</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I  am the fair Izzy, I make the men dizzy<br />
      When  it comes to sailing a boat. But I don't give a damn<br />
      For  I won't race with Sam as a crew<br />
      I  am through, and they say --</p>
    <p class="textcenter">My  name now is Thompson. I'm not from Wisconsin,<br />
      I  worked as a Groome in PA. I've now gained the top<br />
      Since  I've taken the hop up to Trop<br />
      Cheer:  Oh Boy, and they say --</p>
    <p class="textcenter">My  name's Mrs. Hammond, I don't like a mill pond<br />
      The  rougher the better for me. In many a race<br />
      I  have set them the pace. I'm at home<br />
      On  the foam, and they say --</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I'm  Maris Madeira and naught could be clearer<br />
      Than  that I'm at home on the sea. The Agnes or Asthore<br />
      Is  all that I ask for. Each one<br />
      I  am on, and they say --</p>
    <p class="textcenter">My  name is Maria and once I did hire<br />
      A  skipper from over the seas. He told me to tack<br />
      And  I answered right back, I'm no fool<br />
      Here's  the pool, and I say --</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I  am Dimple Dixon, I don't need much fixen<br />
      To  help me sail over the line. Of all the fair ladies<br />
      As  nervous as Hades, that's me, on the sea.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I  WAS BORN ABOUT TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO</p>
    <p class="textcenter">And  there isn't anything that I don't know.<br />
      I  was there when Pharaoh's daughter<br />
      Lifted  Moses from the water,<br />
      And  I'll lick the guy who says it isn't so.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">For  a thousand years I roamed the garden o'er,<br />
      I  saw Eve sliding down the cellar door;<br />
      When  the apple they were eating -- <br />
      I  was round the corner peeking,<br />
      I  swear I am the man who ate the core.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I  rolled the bones with Cain and Abel now and then;<br />
      When  the hand wrote on the wall, I wiped the pen;<br />
      When  Moses smote the mountain<br />
      I  met Becky at the fountain;<br />
      Did  the nights go slow thereafter -- guess again.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I  knew King Solomon and all his wives so fair;<br />
      I  saw Absolom a-hanging by the hair.<br />
      When  I saved kind David's life,<br />
      And  he offered me a wife,<br />
      I  said, &quot;Now you're talking business; have a chair!&quot;</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I  was there when John the Baptist lost his head,<br />
      And  I heard the very words Salome said.<br />
      When  they brought out the bloody charger<br />
      Both  his eyes were growing larger --<br />
      Oh!  My God, a dance like that would raise the dead.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I  was present at the battle of the Nile.<br />
      Did  the bullets whistle there? Well, I should smile.<br />
      When  David caught the King<br />
      With  his cutlass on the wing,<br />
      I  was doing thirty seconds to the mile.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">I  was on board when Hendrick Hudson crossed the sea;<br />
      The  Half Moon dropped anchor just at half-past three.<br />
      We  got off upon the land,<br />
      Shook  the Red Skins by the hand,<br />
      Then  walked up Broadway to Rector's for our tea.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">CHORUS</p>
    <p class="textcenter">No  hiding place down there, Allelulia!<br />
      No  hiding place down there, Praise God!<br />
      Some  come limp and some come lame,<br />
      Some  come shouting the Master's name. No hiding place down there!</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Of  all the religions I love best, I love best<br />
      Of  all the religions I love best, I love best,<br />
      Of  all the religions I love best<br />
      It  is the shouting Methodist! No hiding place down there!</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Sister  Lulu, she wore a low-neck dress, a low-neck dress,<br />
      Sister  Lulu, she wore a low-neck dress, a low-neck dress,<br />
      Sister  Lulu wore a low-neck dress,<br />
      It  was damn low I must confess! No hiding place down there!</p>
    <p class="textcenter">She  stood in the water, ankle-deep, ankle-deep,<br />
      She  stood in the water, ankle-deep, ankle-deep,<br />
      She  stood in the water, ankle-deep,<br />
      And  prayed for the Lord her soul to keep! No hiding place down there!</p>
    <p class="textcenter">A  city man stood at the gates of hell, gates of hell,<br />
      A  city man stood at the gates of hell, gates of hell,<br />
      A  city man stood at the gates of hell,<br />
      He  took one look and down he fell! No hiding place down there!</p>
    <p class="textcenter">My  name is Yon Yonson, I come from Wisconsin;<br />
      I  work in the lumber yards there. As I walk down the street,<br />
      All  the people I meet they say --&quot;What's his name?&quot;</p>
    <p class="textcenter">My  name is John Davis, they all cry -- &quot;God save us!&quot;<br />
      As  I come out of the bar, with a full cocktail shaker<br />
      And  no other taker, they say -- &quot;What a shame, what's his name?&quot;</p>
    <p class="textcenter">CHORUS</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Young  folks, old folks, everybody come,<br />
      Join  the Baptist Sunday School, and have a lot of fun;<br />
      Please  check your chewing-gum and razors at the door,<br />
      And  hear a lot of stories that you've never heard before.</p>
    <p class="textcenter">Adam  was the first man that ever was invented.<br />
